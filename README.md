# DnD-Dice-Roller-app
Did you forget your dice when going to a DnD session? Do you not want to buy your own dice set? Or do you just prefer getting an app to roll your dice for you? DnD Dice Roller is an app that can roll your dice in the game "Dungeons and Dragons". It also contains a simple in app calculator to do basic maths during gameplay. This app can be installed on any phone running android 6 or higher. The source code is also provided.

This is my first GitHub repository(and android app), so I apoligies if any components of the app or the way I have uploaded the folder to GitHub do not make sense to you.

The source code folder of the app is "DnDDiceRoller". You can open this folder in the Android Studio app(here is a link to the Android Studio app download: https://developer.android.com/studio)

I have also attached the finished app installer in the subfolder: DnD-Dice-Roller-app/DnDDiceRoller/app/release/. It is called "app_release.apk"
